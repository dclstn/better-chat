> Hi all, I have some unfortunate news to share.
>
>On Monday 30th June 2025, Snap Inc. (the company behind Snapchat Web) had issued a cease and desist regarding my project. As a result, I have taken down the GitHub repository, Chrome extension, Firefox add-on, and User Scripts.
>
>This wasn’t an easy decision to make, especially given how much the extension has improved Snapchat's Web experience for so many of you. I truly appreciate all the support the project has received, but even with my rebranding efforts, I simply don’t have the time or resources to continue working on this. Huge thanks to everyone who donated — your support meant a lot and helped keep the project going longer than it otherwise could have. I truly appreciate it. ❤️
